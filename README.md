## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

The Luxley Family introduces two joinable NPCs, Sebastian and Andrei Luxley, to your game. Sebastian is a Chaotic Neutral playwright with a rather idiosyncratic sense of humour who appears to take great delight in showing his cousin Andrei the world outside their family home. Andrei is a polite, Lawful Neutral young monk with a strong sense of self who has led a rather sheltered life until now. Throughout your journey with them, you will discover that their family is not all that meets the eye. You may have to make some tough decisions - and the path you choose will have repercussions.

Though you do not need to start a new game to have them join your party, it is advisable to have them join early in order that their story arc is completed. Both banter with all the Bioware party NPCs and they comment on many of the quests in the game.

Sebastian and Andrei both have detailed talk tracks with the PC; they also banter with each other extensively throughout the game.
Note that there is adult content in this mod, but all of it is voluntary on the part of the player - nothing that you feel uncomfortable with is forced on you.

23 February 2021 - Version 1.3:

    Mod traified
    Added native EE-EET compatibility
    Areas, portraits and journal entries are adapted for EE
    Rewrote install procedure to use WeiDU's built-in `HANDLE_AUDIO` function
    Added Gwendolyne's function which automatically removes usability restrictions for EE games.
    Added Tipun's function to find free PVRZ-files indexes on EE-games
    Added `HANDLE_CHARSETS` function to convert string entries for EE games
    Fixed a bug that Kaeloree wrote about: http://www.shsforums.net/topic/35897-dialogue-bugs/#entry412277

I indicated the list of changes in the readme file. I tried to take into account as much as possible to save your time.

P.S. I did not add the EET_TRANSITION function, because it does not make sense - the mod does not have a ToB-part and you cannot call these NPCs through the Fate Spirit.

- Re-formated, updated and moved readme files into new :file_folder: "*readme*" folder.
- Added archive libiconv-1.9.2-1-src.7z with iconv licence info.
- Replaced `AUTHOR` keyword with `SUPPORT`.
- Added *yoshimo.ini* metadata file to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
- tp2 file: added credits for translations and replaced old-school `DECOMPILE_DLG_TO_D` plus `COMPILE_D_TO_DLG` process with more accurate `DECOMPILE_AND_PATCH` command.
- Added `REQUIRE_PREDICATE` process to avoid installing the mod in inaccurate games.
- Added component `DESIGNATED` number and "*yoshimo_friendship*" `LABEL`.
- `README` command now accepts translated files.
- Updated deprecated modding tools links.
- Updated and renamed readme files to *yoshimofriendship-readme-%LANGUAGE%.html*.
- Included Linux and macOS versions in the same package (thanks AL|EN!).
