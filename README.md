## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

The Luxley Family introduces two joinable NPCs, Sebastian and Andrei Luxley, to your game. Sebastian is a Chaotic Neutral playwright with a rather idiosyncratic sense of humour who appears to take great delight in showing his cousin Andrei the world outside their family home. Andrei is a polite, Lawful Neutral young monk with a strong sense of self who has led a rather sheltered life until now. Throughout your journey with them, you will discover that their family is not all that meets the eye. You may have to make some tough decisions - and the path you choose will have repercussions.

Though you do not need to start a new game to have them join your party, it is advisable to have them join early in order that their story arc is completed. Both banter with all the Bioware party NPCs and they comment on many of the quests in the game.

Sebastian and Andrei both have detailed talk tracks with the PC; they also banter with each other extensively throughout the game.

Note that there is adult content in this mod, but all of it is voluntary on the part of the player - nothing that you feel uncomfortable with is forced on you. :wink:

**Key features:**

- A custom Playwright kit for Sebastian, giving him an additional spell per level but also combat penalties.
- A special ability for Andrei, giving him a damage bonus with a Thac0 penalty and wisdom drain.
- A brand-new area, as well as a set edited from the original game areas, along with new non-joinable NPCs.
- A three-stage quest with different paths for each segment.
- A track of up to 9 interactions between the protagonist and both characters.
- A talk track of up to 10 conversations between Sebastian and Andrei.
- Extensive player-initiated-dialogue for both characters which changes depending how much they like the protagonist.
- Custom portraits for Sebastian and Andrei, and optional portraits for various non-party NPCs.
- Extensive voicing, including voicing for eleven non-party NPCs.
- 2-4 banters with the Bioware NPCs in your party.
- Interjections about the player's conversations with non-party NPCs, and interactions with non-party NPCs.
- Tree of Life dialogue with different options depending on the paths you have chosen.
- String fixers (K) in the case of re-installations mixing up Andrei and Sebastian's name strings.
- Custom items, some of which are more useful than others.

 

If you want to write your own NPC talking about or with Sebastian or Andrei, or commenting about their quest, you don't have to ask our permission. However, if you'd like to get in contact and get some ideas going, we're more than willing to put the work in.

	<strong>Menace sur le royaume de Diamant Éternel</strong> is a French mod designed to provide more than a huge quest, without being a total conversion. A tiny part takes place in BG2 Shadows of Amn, but the main part is played in the Throne of Bhaal extension. fhandrem.png<br><br>
	You liked Excalibur, did not you? But have you ever wondered why every woman character is treated as a pest? Guinevere adultery, Morgane the wicked... Why do Paladin Orders recrute only men?<br><br>
	And what if those tales were nothing but a fable spread by men to hide the truth?<br><br>
	This mod tries to restore the truth, at least <em>ITS TRUTH</em>...<br><br>
	The adventure takes place in a parallel dimension, both 'near' and 'far away' from Faerûn, more precisely in the Kingdom of Eternal Diamond, ruled by a dynasty of paladin kings that a renegade paladin attempts to overthrow. To carry out her betrayal, she has made a pact with rather 'special evil forces'...<br><br>
	The kingdom derives its wealth from its minings and its power from the protection of the silver dragon Diamantor, worshipped by some as a demigod.</td>

## <a name="versions" id="versions"></a>Version History



23 February 2021 - Version 1.3:

    Areas, portraits and journal entries are adapted for EE
    Added `HANDLE_CHARSETS` function to convert string entries for EE games
    Fixed a bug that Kaeloree wrote about: http://www.shsforums.net/topic/35897-dialogue-bugs/#entry412277

    - Re-formated, updated and moved readme files into new :file_folder: "*readme*" folder.
    - Replaced `AUTHOR` keyword with `SUPPORT`.
    - Added `REQUIRE_PREDICATE` process to avoid installing the mod in inaccurate games.
    - Added components `DESIGNATED` numbers and "*yoshimo_friendship*" `LABELS`.
    - `README` command now accepts translated files.
    - Updated deprecated modding tools links.
    - Reg-formated, updated, renamed readme file to *luxleysoa-readme-%LANGUAGE%.html*, than moved it into new :file_folder: "*readme*" folder.
    - Included Linux and macOS versions in the same package (thanks AL|EN!).


TODO


    Sebastian soundset: SET_A_TRAP and SELECT_ACTION3 share the same strref (@113 = ~I'm sure you'd do it better.~ [FHLSS31])
    Andrei soundset: SELECT_COMMON1 strref differs in 3 crea files (~~ [FHLASS22] or ~Yes?~ [FHLASS22]). Moreover, there is no FHLASS22.ogg file in audio folder...


##### Version 1.3 &nbsp;(June , 2021)

- Added *luxleysoa.ini* metadata file to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
- Added dynamic install order syntax and global `LABELS` to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
- Renamed *Setup-LuxleySoa.tp2* -> *luxleysoa.tp2* to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
- ...
- Externalized tp2 code into *main_component.tpa* library for more comfortable readability and maintenance.
- Added native EE and EET compatibility:
    - Converted inventory BAMs to EE: This feature attempts to modify original inventory BAMs so that both the large and small icons are utilized by the EE games. The inventory BAM must have two sequences, the first containing the "large" inventory icon frame and the second containing the "small" inventory icon frame to be processed. Inventory icon BAMs in the bam folder that meet these requirements are patched and saved back to the *override* folder
    - .
    - Provided NPCs portraits for EE games.
    - Rewrote install procedure to use WeiDU's built-in `HANDLE_AUDIO` function and converted music files to acm.
    - Provided alternative TIS and PVRZ files for EE games (used Tipun's function to find free PVRZ-files indexes on EE-games).
    - Removed useless audio decoding and tiz unpacking bat `AT_NOW` and `AT_UNINSTALL` processes.
    - `ADD_KIT` process: added missing lower kit strref and fl#add_kit_ee `WeiDU function` for EE games.
- ...
- Sebastian and Andrei soundsets: harmonized string references and removed duplicated ones (due to typos).
- Added a more robust workaround than <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/21964-add_kit-and-tobex/?do=findComment&comment=183270">BWP Fixpack cmorgan's ToBEx compatible ADD_KIT fix</a> to fix Sebastian creature file installation issue with classic games if TobEx is not installed and there are more and 256 kits installed. I know, pretty rare case, but who knows... :wink:
- Cleaned up old ids entries patch replaced with more recent BG2 Fixpack one.
- ...
- Updated *setup.tra* file for compatibility with `GW_UPDATE_ITM_DESCRIPTION_TO_EE` WeiDU function requirements which automatically removes items usability restrictions for EE games.
- TRAified the mod.
- Removed useless :file_folder: "*backup*" folder.
- Lower cased files.
- ...
